## Access to Data

We provide a small sample for the Hansard dataset with labels (where 'M' is MƒÅori, 'P' is English, 'B' is bilingual).

[Hansard data](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/): Text data can be obtained, however, the labels are created by experts manually and is not publicly available. 

[MLT corpus](https://kiwiwords.cms.waikato.ac.nz/corpus/) & [RMT corpus](https://kiwiwords.cms.waikato.ac.nz/rmt_corpus/) are Tweets which can be downloaded directly.
